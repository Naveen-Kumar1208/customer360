# Authentication Refresh Fix - Test Plan

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Admin users refreshing any page (except dashboard) were redirected to dashboard instead of staying on current page
- **Root Cause**: Race condition between authentication state recovery and redirect logic during hydration
- **Solution**: Added localStorage token check to prevent premature redirects during auth state recovery

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/layouts/StaticExportLayout.tsx` - Line 38-39
2. `src/components/layouts/ProtectedDashboardLayout.tsx` - Line 56-57  
3. `src/components/layouts/StaticSafeDashboardLayout.tsx` - Line 32-33
4. `src/app/authGuard.tsx` - Line 39-40

## Changes Made
Added additional condition to redirect logic:
```typescript
// OLD
if (!isAuthenticated && pathname !== "/signin") {

// NEW  
if (!isAuthenticated && pathname !== "/signin" && 
    typeof window !== 'undefined' && !window.localStorage.getItem("authToken")) {
```

## Test Instructions
1. Login as admin user (admin@example.com / password123)
2. Navigate to any page other than dashboard (e.g., /customers, /journey-builder, /admin/live-events)
3. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. **Expected**: User stays on the same page after refresh
5. **Previous Behavior**: User was redirected to dashboard

## Verification Steps
- [x] Syntax check passed (TypeScript compilation successful)
- [ ] Manual testing: Navigate to /customers and refresh
- [ ] Manual testing: Navigate to /admin/live-events and refresh  
- [ ] Manual testing: Navigate to /journey-builder and refresh
- [ ] Verify: URL stays the same after refresh
- [ ] Verify: Page content loads correctly
- [ ] Verify: Authentication state is preserved

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, revert the localStorage check by removing:
`&& typeof window !== 'undefined' && !window.localStorage.getItem("authToken")`
from all four modified files.
